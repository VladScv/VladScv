- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @VladScv
- :crown: I'm a neo-expressionist artist, or like I preferred to say, a Trash-Art maker :) don't hesitate to take an eye to my other face in Ig @scvria
- :beginner:Iâ€™m currently studying software engineering as code is my other passion beside art.
- :skull: By now probably I'm far away from most of the talented minds that live here, but I would like to get involved in some project asap
-  But by now I'm not sure wich IT way choose, I'm interested in 3D (as I've got designer skills), AI, ML... but just learning C, Java and starting with BackEnd web development
- ðŸ“« If you have any offer or project where I can help and learn more contact me, I'm wishing to collaborate and increase my skills :smile:
